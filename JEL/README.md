#  JELLI ENGINE LEDGERS  #
Specification by Go Shoemake <3

- - -

Although it is technically possible to construct a Jelli Game using only JavaScript, for large games this will prove cumbersome and using data files for initialization is recommended instead.
These files take the format of Jelli Engine Ledgers (JELs), which are an implementation of the Generally Easy Ledger (GEL) syntax specified [here](http://langdev.xyz/documentation/standards/WD/0003.txt).

This file specifies all of the possible record types and their appropriate semantics.
An ELM file, which provides the syntactic basis for JELs, is viewable [here](JEL.elm).
