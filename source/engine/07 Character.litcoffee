    CHARACTER
    The Jelli Game Engine
    ---------------------
    ###

`Character`s are `Unit`s with support for scripting, animation, and multiple sprites.
They are generated from `CHARACTER` elements.

###  The constructor:  ###

The `Character` constructor generates a `Character` from a `CHARACTER` element.
It has only two required arguments: `collection` and `name`, which hold the same meaning as they do for all `Collection` instances.
However, the arguments `id`, `x`, `y`, and `sprite` may be passed in to initialize the values of those respective properties.
This takes a variety of forms:

- `Character(collection, name)`
- `Character(collection, name, id)`
- `Character(collection, name, x, y)`
- `Character(collection, name, x, y, sprite)`
- `Character(collection, name, id, x, y, sprite)`

Note that if `id` is not set, it is assumed to be `name`.

    Character = (collection, name, optional_args...) ->

>   **Note :**
    There is no explicit call to `Jelli` here because `Character` inherits from `Unit`, which is already a `Jelli` object.

Because of our optional arguments, we have to do some argument detection.
We'll go ahead and use a `switch` statement:

        switch optional_args.length
            when 0 then id = name
            when 1 then id = optional_args[0]
            when 2
                id = name
                x = null if isNaN(x = Number(optional_args[0]))
                y = null if isNaN(y = Number(optional_args[1]))
            when 3
                id = name
                x = null if isNaN(x = Number(optional_args[0]))
                y = null if isNaN(y = Number(optional_args[1]))
                current_sprite = optional_args[2]
            else
                id = optional_args[0]
                x = null if isNaN(x = Number(optional_args[1]))
                y = null if isNaN(y = Number(optional_args[2]))
                current_sprite = optional_args[3]
        current_sprite = 0 unless current_sprite?

For convenience, we get `game` and `area` from `collection`:

        collection = null unless collection instanceof Collection
        game = if collection? then collection.game else null
        area = if collection? then collection.area else null

We also need to get the `CHARACTER` element:

        elt = game?.getDataElement("CHARACTER", id) || null

We can now load the `Character` sprites.
The `data-sprites` attribute on the `CHARACTER` element gives us the `SPRITELIST` element which contains them.

        sprites = {}
        sprite_list = game?.getDataElement("SPRITELIST", elt?.getAttribute("data-sprites")) || null

We can then load the sprites from the `SPRITELIST`.
Sprites can be referenced both by either index or name, so we define the latter to be an alias for the former.
Because neither HTML attributes nor JavaScript object keys distinguish between numbers and strings, we make the additional restriction that names must be non-numeric.

        for sprite, index in sprite_list?.getElementsByClassName("SPRITE") || []
            sprites[index] =  game?.sheets[sprite_list.dataset.sheet]?.getSprite(sprite.dataset.index, sprite.dataset.length) || null
            sprites[sprite.getAttribute("title")] = sprites[index] if sprite.hasAttribute("title") and isNaN(sprite.getAttribute("title"))
        Object.freeze sprites

We now have everything we need to initialize `Character` as a `Unit`:

        Unit.call this, area, game.screens[elt?.getAttribute("data-screen")], id, x, y, sprite_list?.dataset.boxWidth || sprites[0]?.width, sprite_list?.dataset.boxHeight || sprites[0]?.height, sprite_list?.dataset.originX, sprite_list?.dataset.originY

We can then define additional properties unique to the `Character` object.
The following are non-enumerable, so we use `Object.defineProperties`:

        Object.defineProperties this, {
            box_x: {value: if isNaN(sprite_list?.dataset.boxX) then 0 else Number(sprite_list?.dataset.boxX)}
            box_y: {value: if isNaN(sprite_list?.dataset.boxY) then 0 else Number(sprite_list?.dataset.boxY)}
            collides:
                value: switch elt?.dataset.collides
                    when undefined then Character.collisions.DOES_NOT_COLLIDE
                    when "map" then Character.collisions.MAP
                    when "character" then Character.collisions.CHARACTER
                    else Character.collisions.ALL
            functions: {value: elt?.functions}
            sprite_height: {value: sprites[0]?.height || 0}
            sprite_width: {value: sprites[0]?.width}
            sprites: {value: sprites}
            step: {value: @run.bind(this, "step")}
        }

There are also some enumerable properties on `Character`.
These all can be modified by users or other functions, so we use getters and setters to ensure that they always return the proper type.

This sets the initial values for these properties:

        current_sprite = 0 unless this.sprites[current_sprite]
        direction = null
        frame = 0
        velocity = 0

And now we can define the getters and setters:

        Object.defineProperties this, {
            direction:
                get: -> direction
                set: (n) -> direction = if isNaN(n) then null else Number(n)
                enumerable: yes
            frame:
                get: -> frame
                set: (n) -> frame = n unless isNaN(n = Number(n)) or n < 0 or n >= @sprites[@sprite].frames
                enumerable: yes
            sprite:
                get: -> current_sprite
                set: (n) -> current_sprite = n if this.sprites[n]?
                enumerable: yes
            velocity:
                get: -> velocity
                set: (n) -> velocity = Number(n) unless isNaN(n)
                enumerable: yes
        }

Finally, we can run the `Character`'s initialization code, and seal the resulting object.

        @run("init")

        Object.seal this

###  The prototype:  ###

The `Character` prototype provides functions for drawing `Character`s, handling collisions, and moving them towards a given point.

    Character.prototype = Object.create(Unit.prototype, {

The `draw()` function is simple: it just calls the `draw()` function of the current sprite.

        draw:
            value: -> return @sprites[@sprite]?.draw(@screen?.context, @edges.screen_left - @box_x, @edges.screen_top - @box_y, @frame)

`getCollisionEdge()` is used in the same manner as `Tilemap.getCollisionEdge()`.
However, because `Character`s don't have collision zones, the code is much more simple.

        getCollisionEdge:
            value: (edge, x, y) ->

First we need to make sure that we were passed the arguments that we expect:

                return unless (edge is Tileset.Map.BOTTOM_EDGE or edge is Tileset.Map.LEFT_EDGE or edge is Tileset.Map.RIGHT_EDGE or edge is Tileset.Map.TOP_EDGE) and !isNaN(x = Number(x)) and !isNaN(y = Number(y))

If (1) the object doesn't collide with other `Character`s, or (2) the point is outside of the object's bounds, then we return the original coordinate:

                unless @collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER and Math.round(@edges.left) < x < Math.round(@edges.right) and Math.round(@edges.top) < y < Math.round(@edges.bottom)
                    switch edge
                        when Tileset.Map.LEFT_EDGE, Tileset.Map.RIGHT_EDGE then return x
                        when Tileset.Map.TOP_EDGE, Tileset.Map.BOTTOM_EDGE then return y

Otherwise, we return the proper edge:

                switch edge
                    when Tileset.Map.LEFT_EDGE then return Math.round(@edges.left)
                    when Tileset.Map.RIGHT_EDGE then return Math.round(@edges.right)
                    when Tileset.Map.TOP_EDGE then return Math.round(@edges.top)
                    when Tileset.Map.BOTTOM_EDGE then return Math.round(@edges.bottom)
                return

`target()` is a convenience function for running `targetBy()` with absolute, instead of relative, coordinates.

        target: {value: (cx, cy) -> @targetBy(cx - @x, cy - @y)}

`targetBy()` moves the character 1 pixel or less towards the provided coordinate, given relative to the character's own origin.
It's two arguments, `dx` and `dy`, specify this coordinate.

>   [Issue #41](https://github.com/literallybenjam/jelli/issues/41) :
    The maximum value of 1px should be configurable through `data-*` attributes.

        targetBy:
            value: (dx, dy) ->

First, we calculate the magnitude of the distance vector:

                d = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)

Next, we ensure that everything is set up properly for us to do our calculations:

                return unless this.area instanceof Area and this.area.characters instanceof Collection and this.area.maps instanceof Object and d

We set `ix` and `iy` to the `Character`'s initial position.
We will need these later for direction and velocity calculations.

                ix = @x
                iy = @y

If `d` is larger than `1`, then we make our velocity a unit vector:

                if d > 1
                    dx = dx / d
                    dy = dy / d

Note, however, that if `d` is smaller than `1`, we don't scale the vector up.

>   [Issue #41](https://github.com/literallybenjam/jelli/issues/41) :
    The upper-bound for `d` may be settable through `data-*` attributes at some point in the future.

We can now calculate the horizontal movement of the character.

>   **Note :**
    The fact that horizontal movement is calculated first means that if a `Character` walks diagonally while kitty-corner to a collision sector, it will travel horizontally along that sector rather than vertically.
    For example, in the following scenario:

|    |    |
|----|----|
| 　 | ⬛ |
| 🐊 | 　 |

>   …🐊 will move horizontally rightward (by `Math.SQRT2 / 2`) if 🐊.targetBy(1, -1) is called.
    This is an extreme edge case (as it requires the `Character` to be lined up *perfectly* along the diagonal), but is worth noting regardless.
    The most important takeway is that, in these scenarios, the `Character` does *not* stand still.

We run two separate cases depending on whether the `Character` is moving to the right or left, but the underlying algorithms are very similar.
Let's look at the rightward case:

                if dx > 0

First, we set `s` to the right edge of the `Character`, incremented by `dx`.
If a collision is going to happen, it will happen here.

                    s = @edges.right + dx

Then we check for collisions with the map, if appliciable, by iterating over `maps`:

                    if @collides & Character.collisions.MAP
                        for map in @area.maps

`k` tells us how many collision points we need to check in order to ensure we didn't miss any map sectors.
We take the height of the `Character` and divide it by the height of a map sector.
This still isn't enough if the `Character` happens to be perfectly aligned (note from [the `Tileset` documentation](tileset.litcoffee) that collisions aren't detected on sector edges), so we need to add `1`.

                            k = Math.floor(@height / (map.tile_height / 2)) + 1

>   [Issue #49](https://github.com/literallybenjam/jelli/issues/49) :
    The `/ 2` in the above code assumes each tile is split up into four sectors, two in each direction.
    This is currently how `Tilemap` operates, but the plan is to change this going forward.

We can then iterate over all of our collision points, getting the left collision edge using `getCollisionEdge()`.
If this edge is further left than `s`, we move `s` back to be flush with the edge.

                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = map.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.LEFT_EDGE, s, @edges.top + j * @height / k)
                                s = t if s > t

Now, we do the same thing, only iterating over the area's `Character`s.

                    if @collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER
                        @area.characters.doForEach (some) =>

We don't need (or *want*) to check if a `Character` collides with itself, and we also shouldn't check for collisions with `Character`s for which `Character`-collision is disabled.

                            return if this is some or not (some.collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER)

Our `k` is similar, only we use the `Character` height as our sector.

                            k = Math.floor(@height / some.height) + 1

…And then we iterate over our points.

                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = some.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.LEFT_EDGE, s, @edges.top + j * @height / k)
                                s = t if s > t

If our final `s` is still further right than our original right edge, then we go ahead and move the `Character`:

                    @edges.right = s if s > @edges.right

…And now we do the same thing for leftward motion, only using the left edge:

                if dx < 0
                    s = @edges.left + dx
                    if @collides & Character.collisions.MAP
                        for map in @area.maps
                            k = Math.floor(@height / (map.tile_height / 2)) + 1
                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = map.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.RIGHT_EDGE, s, @edges.top + j * @height / k)
                                s = t if s < t
                    if @collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER
                        @area.characters.doForEach (some) =>
                            return if this is some or not (some.collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER)
                            k = Math.floor(@height / some.height) + 1
                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = some.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.RIGHT_EDGE, s, @edges.top + j * @height / k)
                                s = t if s < t
                    @edges.left = s if s < @edges.left

And then for upward and downward motion, switching our widths and heights:

                if dy > 0
                    s = @edges.bottom + dy
                    if @collides & Character.collisions.MAP
                        for map in @area.maps
                            k = Math.floor(@width / (map.tile_width / 2)) + 1
                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = map.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.TOP_EDGE, @edges.left + j * @width / k, s)
                                s = t if s > t
                    if @collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER
                        @area.characters.doForEach (some) =>
                            return if this is some or not (some.collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER)
                            k = Math.floor(@width / some.width) + 1
                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = some.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.TOP_EDGE, @edges.left + j * @width / k, s)
                                s = t if s > t
                    @edges.bottom = s if s > @edges.bottom
                if dy < 0
                    s = @edges.top + dy
                    if @collides & Character.collisions.MAP
                        for map in @area.maps
                            k = Math.floor(@width / (map.tile_width / 2)) + 1
                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = map.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.BOTTOM_EDGE, @edges.left + j * @width / k, s)
                                s = t if s < t
                    if @collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER
                        @area.characters.doForEach (some) =>
                            return if this is some or not (some.collides & Character.collisions.CHARACTER)
                            k = Math.floor(@width / some.width) + 1
                            j = -1
                            while ++j <= k
                                t = some.getCollisionEdge(Tileset.Map.BOTTOM_EDGE, @edges.left + j * @width / k, s)
                                s = t if s < t
                    @edges.top = s if s < @edges.top

*(Whew!)*

With that done, our `Character` has been successfully moved.
We now set the `direction` and `velocity` properties based on the change in position.
We can go ahead and overwrite `dx` and `dy`, since we won't be needing their old values anymore.

                dx = @x - ix
                dy = @y - iy

We use a atan2 function to set the `direction`.
This is an angle in radians, clockwise from due north:

                @direction = Math.atan2(dx, -dy)

`velocity` uses the same magnitude function we used to calculate `d`:

                @velocity = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)

>   *Note :*
    `velocity` is thus in units of px/tick

We are now done with the `Character` prototype, and can freeze it and move on.

    })

    Object.freeze Character.prototype

###  Final touches:  ###

The `Character.collisions` object stores aliases for values used to determine the kinds of objects with which the `Character` collides.
Bitwise operations can be used to check if a `Character` collides with a certain type of object (note that `Character.collisions.ALL is Character.collisions.MAP | Character.collisions.CHARACTER`.)

    Character.collisions =
        DOES_NOT_COLLIDE: 0x0
        MAP: 0x1
        CHARACTER: 0x2
        ALL: 0x3
    Object.freeze Character.collisions

We can now freeze `Character` and make it transparent to the window:

    @Character = Object.freeze(Character)
